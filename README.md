# ScrawlD: A Dataset of Real World Ethereum Smart Contracts Labelled with Vulnerabilities

## Smart Contracts
   contract folder contains smart contracts

## Vulnerabilities
   vulnerabilites.json contains vulnerabilites in each smart contracts as per reported by 5 tools (Slither, Smartcheck, Mythril, Oyente, Osiris)

   | Vulnerability | Description   |
   | ------------- | ------------- |
   | Tx-Origin  |  Authorization through tx.origin |
   | ARTHM  | Arithmetic (Integer Overflow and Underflow)  |
   | DOS | Denial of Service |
   | LE | Locked Ether |
   | RENT | Reentrancy |
   | TimeM | Block values as a proxy for time |
   | TimeO | Transaction Order Dependence |
   | UE | Unchecked Call Return Value |



### vulnerabilites.json Format Example:

   "0x000000002bb43c83ece652d161ad0fa862129a2c": {  <br />
       "ARTHM": {  <br />
           "mythril": [  <br />
               350, <br />
               372, <br />
           ], <br />
           "osiris": [ <br />
               105, <br />
           ] <br />
       }, <br />
       "LE": [ <br />

               "Vote.rescueToken(address)" <br />
           ], <br />
           "slither": [ <br />
               "Vote.vote1(address,address)", <br />
           ] <br />
       }, <br />
   } <br />

   1. Above snippet is taken from file vulnerabilities.json
   2. It shows an object in vulnerabilities.json file
   3. According to above snippet, smart contract deployed on address 0x000000002bb43c83ece652d161ad0fa862129a2c at Ethereum blockchain contains Arithmetic (ARTHM) vulnerability at line number 350 and 372 according to results generated by Mythril tool
   4. Reentrancy (RENT) is a function level bug. That's why we showed ContractName.FunctionName in vulnerabilities.json file.
   5. Moreover, Locked Ether (LE) is contract level bug. So, if the tool says that contract is vulnerable for LE, we printed tool-name for LE in vulnerabilities.json file.
